This repository is a honeypot for those trash code contributors

## Background

This porject is just a social experiment.
I intentionally left some typos and other quesitons to attract the attention of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/honeytoberfest) attendees.
As long as you carefully read the contents of this readme, you will leave with an understanding.


## Structure
